Predicting Car Insurance Claim
This dataset was provided as part of the capstone project for ISEN-613 (Engineering Data Analysis) course. In this dataset containing 100,000 entries merely 720 were insurance claims. As this is a highly unbalanced dataset, oversampling techniques such as SMOTE utilized to prepare a curated training dataset. Missing values were dealt using median imputation. As the data contained both numeric and categorical data, dummy variables were created were also created.

RandomForest, Neural Network and Adaptive boosting were found to be the best models for predicting insurance claims based on vehicle owner and vehicle information data.
